# BackPack
This is the copy of an E-Store that I developed in my Fall 2022 semester. 

The original project is posted here - https://github.com/SWEN610-F22/backpack. Since this Repository is 'Private', therefore I am posting a copy of this project here separately.

I developed this E-store with my teammates @monoshizmkhan, @ss8650, @reginaafu, @utkarsh2111, under the guidance of my professor @tawvse. 
The specialty of this E-store is that users can make a list of products that they would like to recommend others to use for a specific activity at a particular place.
